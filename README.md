This project is a machine learning model developed in a Jupyter Notebook to detect breast cancer based on a provided dataset. The model uses various features of cell nuclei to classify tumors as benign (B) or malignant (M).

Project Overview
Data Loading and Exploration: The project begins by loading the data.csv dataset and performing an initial exploratory data analysis to understand the features and target variable.

Data Preprocessing: Handles any missing values and prepares the data for the machine learning model.

Model Training: Utilizes a machine learning algorithm from the scikit-learn library to train a classification model on the dataset.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

Model Persistence: The trained model is saved using pickle to allow for future use without retraining.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x

The required libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/Siddhartha-pixel/Breast-Cancer-Detection.git](https://github.com/Siddhartha-pixel/Breast-Cancer-Detection.git)
cd Breast-Cancer-Detection

Install the required Python libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Dataset
The project uses a dataset named data.csv. This file contains the features extracted from images of breast masses, as well as the corresponding diagnosis (benign or malignant). It is a critical component for the notebook to run successfully.

Usage
Open the Notebook: Open the Breast cancer detector.ipynb file in a Jupyter environment (e.g., JupyterLab or Visual Studio Code).

Run the Cells: Execute all the cells in the notebook sequentially. The notebook will guide you through each step, from data loading to model evaluation.

Project Structure
Breast cancer detector.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for the project.

data.csv: The dataset used to train and test the model.

README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

requirements.txt: Lists all Python dependencies.

.gitignore: A file to keep the repository clean by ignoring unnecessary files.
